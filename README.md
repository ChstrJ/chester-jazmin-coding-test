#### Answer the question below by updating this file.

Q: The management requested a new feature where in the fictional e-commerce app must have a "featured products" section.
How would you go about implementing this feature in the backend?

A: First I would create a column name is_featured which have a boolean type, then create a new endpoint can update the product the is_featured to true, and then create a new endpoint /api/products/featured/ and get all the feauted products and make sure to query the latest featured product based on the timestamp.
